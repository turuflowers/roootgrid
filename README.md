roootGrid
=========

Summary
---

Very basic responsive grid, 320px module base.
It has modules of 320px, till 960px (for now).
It's great for simple responsive prototyping, because the media queries breakpoints are only three.

It's not a framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Foundation] (http://foundation.zurb.com/). You still have to make the CSS for all the elements... but you have a responsive grid that let you free-styling.

If you need a framework, you could use Bootstrap, Foundation, etc., or you could combine this grid with micro CSS frameworks, like [MOSTO] (http://www.valdelama.com/mosto), [Colors] (http://clrs.cc/), [Normalize] (http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), and many others.
